It works best when you input specific book titles in your query rather than referring to their order in a series. Utilize the following codes to target specific data types: TX=All Text, AU=Author, TI=Title, SU=Subject, SO=Source, AB=Abstract, IS=ISSN [8-digit code], IB=ISBN [13-digit code]. Combine search terms using logical operators like AND/OR. If the book title or any other search parameter is not certain, use proximity operators such as NEAR(N), WITHIN(W) to specify the closeness of terms. For a more precise search, apply quotes for an exact phrase, * for a wildcard, ? for single character substitution, and # for single/no character substitution..Parameters names and types:\n\t+ query: REQUIRED string. Format your search in the EBSCO query style with specific book titles and fix very obvious spellings. For example, 'AU Neil Gaiman AND TI Sandman'. In case of uncertainty about book titles or if the query uses words such as like or something or other parameters, use proximity operators in the format 'TI BookTitle1 N# BookTitle2' where '#' is the number of words in between. Avoid using special characters except when implementing specific search techniques.
